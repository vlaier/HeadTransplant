## Head Transplant

The goal of this project is to make the best possible site that's uses woocommerce api as a backend.

## About

Woocommerce is [the most popular ecommerce solution.](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/ecommerce) but because it's hard to offer users good experience while using it. This creates a gap for headless solutions like this. Thanks to using next.js as storefront I can offer already existings e-commerce store owners an easy and pain free switch from their current storefront to this solution. Store owners would keep  Woocommerce's dashboard that they are familiar with and their and at the same time they could offer faster and more agile storefront to theris customers.
