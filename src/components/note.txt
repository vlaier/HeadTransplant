This is the hell of my own creation. The structure of components is amalgamation of sevreal ideas about what folder structure should look like in this project. First idea was seperation of SWR hooks from all the others, then came the idea of maybe there should be two files in one folder, in the meantime came some changes to the to visual components files and theirs folders :<  
Beyond problems with structure there are also problems with how components work. Fallbacks aren't behaving how I would like them to and infinite scrolling goes into loop of the same products. Ehhh so much work to do. For the project to have any chance of scaling I have to make it cleaner, faster, more productive. I despreatly need good structure.
